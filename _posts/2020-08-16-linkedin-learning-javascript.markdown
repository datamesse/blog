Based on an exercise from [LinkedIn Learning: JavaScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training-3) by Morten Rand-Hendriksen [@mor10](https://twitter.com/mor10).

I expanded on the original by adding:
  * Random quotes on page reload or by clicking the "Start over" button - 23-08-2020
  * Saving consecutive words per minute (WPM) scores to an array, which clears if page is reloaded - 23-08-2020
