Follow-the-sun customer support metrics and dashboards in Power BI and Tableau.

Having worked in follow-the-sun application support for a few years, this post covers the metrics I worked out to help identify 


Cities covered by the support team
Cities missed by the support team
% responses covered by 

median 1st response time
median post 1st response times
response efficiency: number of public resposes / distinct coont of Ticket IDs
this should excclude customers whose time zones ar outside those naturally supported by office times

% responding to tickets from other timezones replied on in own timezone
Ideally 100%
THis may need to factor in subsequent timezones


median assignment times



Response Efficiency


The past few posts on this blog have ben a 




Most articles and dashboards cover either strategic level numbers, such as Net Promoter Scores or 


Do we cover our client's cities in their office timezones?
Which cities do we struggle to cover?



How should follow-the-sun support model be measured?

The degree in which one city responds to tickets in another region

Proportion of rsponses to clients for a given timezone




Are my staff from region B looking after responses to tickets in region A?

Why measuring only Occupancy is bad:
Occupancy indicates how much of an agent’s time they are paid for is spent working on the things your organization wants them to work on. It’s a critical KPI because it answers the first question: “Is time being spent where it should be spent?” But what it doesn’t tell us is if that time is being used productively. Effectively tracking productivity means there are other metrics to consider.

Why measuring only Productivity is bad:
Productivity is a critical component because it tells us how much work an agent is doing. What it does not tell us is the quality of the work performed (Satisfaction) nor does it tell us if productivity is being maximized by filling all available time (Occupancy). If a customer receives poor customer service, productivity likely won't be the correct indicator to look at.
